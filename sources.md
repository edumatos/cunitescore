# SVN #

You can get the sources by checking out the latest version from [SVN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)).

If you don't have a SVN client already installed, we recommend [tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) for Windows. Here is a [list of SVN clients](http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#all-clients).

Once your client is installed, create a `unitescore` folder on your computer, and check out the latest sources over http : http://cunitescore.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

If you never used a SVN client, you can gave a look at this [SVN checkout tutorial](http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dczs397v_12ftrscdd9) that has been done for another google code project.


# Download #

You can also download an archinve with all the sources. The download packages are updated quite often but you will not always get the latest sources.
