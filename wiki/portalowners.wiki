#summary Description of requirements for a portal to be included in the cUniteScore project.

= Game ID =
  * The game id will not be hard coded in the game. You need to pass all necessary variables to the .swf with the url flash vars arguments.


= Player name ? =
  * The cUniteScore project manage mostly member only score systems. Systems where you don't need to enter a nickname.
  * If your score system is open to all visitors, this requires the player to enter a nickname. This is not managed by the cUniteScore project. You must provide/host a GUI swf for the player to enter his/her nickname and to save the score on your servers. Your GUI will be dynamically loaded by the cUnitScore system and displayed on top of the game. Get in touch with us for more details.
