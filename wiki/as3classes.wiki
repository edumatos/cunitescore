#summary How to use AS3 classes.

= Introduction =

First you have to get the latest [sources sources].

= Actionscript 3 =

Then you have to copy/include the AS3 package in your project. You can either copy the folder {{{unitescore}}} from the {{{as3}}} directory into your project root directory or add the {{{as3}}} directory in your classpath.

== Basic use (timeline) ==

In the first frame of your movie import the class and create an instance of it:
{{{
import unitescore.CUniteScoreAS3;

var scoreSubmitter : CUniteScoreAS3 = new CUniteScoreAS3(this);
}}}
you can as well instantiate the mochiads leaderboard in the same frame:
{{{
scoreSubmitter.initMochiAdsLeaderboard("xxx", "yyy");
}}}
where *"xxx"* is your game mochiad ID and *"yyy"* is your leaderboard ID.

In game over, or whenever you want to submit the score:
{{{
scoreSubmitter.sendScore(score);
}}}
where *score* is the variable name of your game score.

You're done!
Just adding those lines of code your game will post scores to the different portals listed on the [http://code.google.com/p/cunitescore/ Project Homepage].
