First of all you would need to checkout the AS2 version of unitescore from the [http://code.google.com/p/cunitescore/source/checkout Source page] to your project folder.
Be sure you checkout only the AS2 version, ie:
https://cunitescore.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cunitescore/as2/unitescore

== Basic use ==

In the first frame of your movie, import the class and create an instance of it:
{{{
import unitescore.CUniteScoreAS2;

var scoreSubmitter : CUniteScoreAS2 = new CUniteScoreAS2();
}}}
you can as well instantiate the mochiads leaderboard in the same frame:
{{{
scoreSubmitter.initMochiAdsLeaderboard("xxx", "yyy");
}}}
where *"xxx"* is your game mochiadID and *"yyy"* is your leaderboardID.

In game over, either when submitting through a button or in the last frame:
{{{
scoreSubmitter.sendScore(score);
}}}
where *score* is the variable name of your game score.

You're done!
Just adding those lines of code your game will post scores to the different portals listed on the [http://code.google.com/p/cunitescore/ Project Homepage].
